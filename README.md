do you like paying taxes while watching your city's infrastructure deteriorates?  do you love watching politicians boast their exorbitant net worths while you pay 40% of your income to uncle sam?  isn't it wonderful to see civil servants underpaid while the latest and greatest embezzler makes off with their 10th supercar? 

### ethereum revenue service is the solution
while each physical US dollar comes with a unique serial number, the digital USD does not.  unless you pay your taxes in cash, your payment could go straight into the mayor's bank account and you would never know.  

enter the blockchain.  
- when each taxpayer pays their taxes, their payment is sent straight to the central bank 
- the central bank will then mint multiple nfts, each with an equivalent value to the taxes paid (ex: one NFT for city taxes, one for state taxes, one for fed taxes)
- the NFTs are then awarded to govt. services in need of funding (ex: CSU, UC, bart receive batches of nfts, coast guard and army receive more, etc)
- NFTs are then fractionalized and distributed to individual employees as payment
- employees may then sell their nfts back to the federal reserve in exchange for money, or visit participating businesses to use fractions of their nfts to pay for goods (vegroceries, vcdonalds, vurgerking etc)
- businesses may sell their nfts to federal reserve for legal tender
- the nfts are destroyed following return to the fed. reserve to avoid infinite money printing

  ### benefits

  - taxpayers can log into their dashboard and see where their tax NFTs have gone
  - anonymity will be preserved (ie employee names will be censored as lockheed martin engineer, coast guard grunt, etc) with exceptions for politicians (ex: if nancy pelosi received 99999 tax nfts)
  - unusual activity can be flagged automatically and viewed by citizens (ex: lockheed martin converted all its nfts into cash)
  - finally we can see where are taxes are going!
